<li>The trip to Vestkapp for a weekend during summer went well, despite mixed weather conditions 
    and my lack of license at that time. To make the entire trip to Vestkapp possible, I was accompanied by 3 other MC drivers. Since my first MC clothes were meant for 3-4 seasons, they kept me warm and dry, despite quite a bit of rain occasionally.

<li>My first long trip to Belgium, only a week or so after receiving my MC license, went from 
    Haugesund to Stavanger during quite a bit of rain, after which I boarded the ferry and landed 
    in Hirtshals, Denmark. After a small break to sort a few things out, the horrible weather 
    from Norway caught up with me, and the trip through half of Denmark was a quite wet, chilly 
    and an uncomfortable experience. Further more, some issues with Google Maps and having decided to 
    make the trip to Stralsund by driving across the southers Danish islands instead, I ended up 
    having to waste time arguing with Gmaps on the exact path. Bad planning ahead also led me to 
    realise that the small area in Denmark was not connected to Germany by Tunnel or Bridge, but 
    rather by an expensive ferry. Arriving quite late at the other side, additonal time was spent 
    driving to Stralsund in chilly temperatures.
